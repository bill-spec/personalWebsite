    <p class = "about">

        Welcome to my site.
        <br></br>
        <img src = "imgs/profile.jpg" alt="Personal Photo">
        It's really for my dog but I guess my stuff is here too. 
        
        <br></br>
        I am currently working at the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant in the Division of International Finance. I was previosuly a student at the 
        University of Pittsburgh where I studied economics, statistics and computer science. 

        <br></br>
        My research interests are focused on emperical corporate finance and household finance focused on American saving. 

        <br></br>
        In my free time I am either programming, lifting, or watching the remains of the Starcraft GSL. I have the autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis and occasionally 
        write about my experience to best get a handle of chronic health conditions. 
        
        <br></br>
        The website was built and maintained by me. Recomendations on html/css/javascript are always appreciated! 

    </p>
