        Welcome to my site.
        <br></br>
        <img src = "imgs/profile.jpg" alt="Personal Photo">
        It's really for my dog but I guess my stuff is here too. 

        I am currently working at the Federal Reserve Board as a research assistant. I was previosuly a student at the 
        University of Pittsburgh where I studied economics, statistics and computer science. In my free time I am either programming, reading nonfiction, or watching the Starcraft GSL. 
        <br></br>
        The website was built and maintained by me. Recomendations on html/css/javascript are always appreciated!
